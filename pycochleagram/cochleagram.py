  """Generate the subband envelopes (i.e., the cochleagram)
  of the provided signal.

  This first creates a an ERB filterbank with the provided input arguments for
  the provided signal. This filterbank is then used to perform the subband
  decomposition to create the subband envelopes. The resulting envelopes can be
  optionally downsampled and then modified with a nonlinearity.

  Args:
    signal (array): The sound signal (waveform) in the time domain. Should be
      flattened, i.e., the shape is (n_samples,).
    sr (int): Sampling rate associated with the signal waveform.
    n (int): Number of filters (subbands) to be generated with standard
      sampling (i.e., using a sampling factor of 1). Note, the actual number of
      filters in the generated filterbank depends on the sampling factor, and
      will also include lowpass and highpass filters that allow for
      perfect reconstruction of the input signal (the exact number of lowpass
      and highpass filters is determined by the sampling factor).
    low_lim (int): Lower limit of frequency range. Filters will not be defined
      below this limit.
    hi_lim (int): Upper limit of frequency range. Filters will not be defined
      above this limit.
    sample_factor (int): Positive integer that determines how densely ERB function
     will be sampled to create bandpass filters. 1 represents standard sampling;
     adjacent bandpass filters will overlap by 50%. 2 represents 2x overcomplete sampling;
     adjacent bandpass filters will overlap by 75%. 4 represents 4x overcomplete sampling;
     adjacent bandpass filters will overlap by 87.5%.
    padding_size (int, optional): If None (default), the signal will not be padded
      before filtering. Otherwise, the filters will be created assuming the
      waveform signal will be padded to length padding_size+signal_length.
    downsample (None, int, callable, optional): The `downsample` argument can
      be an integer representing the upsampling factor in polyphase resampling
      (with `sr` as the downsampling factor), a callable
      (to perform custom downsampling), or None to return the
      unmodified cochleagram; see `apply_envelope_downsample` for more
      information. If `ret_mode` is 'envs', this will be applied to the
      cochleagram before the nonlinearity, otherwise no downsampling will be
      performed. Providing a callable for custom downsampling is suggested.
    nonlinearity ({None, 'db', 'power', callable}, optional): The `nonlinearity`
      argument can be an predefined type, a callable
      (to apply a custom nonlinearity), or None to return the unmodified
      cochleagram; see `apply_envelope_nonlinearity` for more information.
      If `ret_mode` is 'envs', this will be applied to the cochleagram after
      downsampling, otherwise no nonlinearity will be applied. Providing a
      callable for applying a custom nonlinearity is suggested.
    fft_mode ({'auto', 'fftw', 'np'}, optional): Determine what implementation
      to use for FFT-like operations. 'auto' will attempt to use pyfftw, but
      will fallback to numpy, if necessary.
    ret_mode ({'envs', 'subband', 'analytic', 'all'}): Determines what will be
      returned. 'envs' (default) returns the subband envelopes; 'subband'
      returns just the subbands, 'analytic' returns the analytic signal provided
      by the Hilbert transform, 'all' returns all local variables created in this
      function.
    strict (bool, optional): If True (default), will include the extra
      highpass and lowpass filters required to make the filterbank invertible.
      If False, this will only perform calculations on the bandpass filters; note
      this decreases the number of frequency channels in the output by
       2 * `sample_factor`.
      function is used in a way that is unsupported by the MATLAB implemenation.
    strict (bool, optional): If True (default), will throw an errors if this
      function is used in a way that is unsupported by the MATLAB implemenation.

  Returns:

    **out**: The output, depending on the value of `ret_mode`. If the `ret_mode`
      is 'envs' and a downsampling and/or nonlinearity
      operation was requested, the output will reflect these operations.

  """Apply a nonlinearity to the cochleagram.

  The `nonlinearity` argument can be an predefined type, a callable
  (to apply a custom nonlinearity), or None to return the unmodified
  cochleagram.

  Args:
    subband_envelopes (array): Cochleagram to apply the nonlinearity to.
    nonlinearity ({'db', 'power'}, callable, None): Determines the nonlinearity
      operation to apply to the cochleagram. If this is a valid string, one
      of the predefined nonlinearities will be used. It can be: 'power' to
      perform np.power(subband_envelopes, 3.0 / 10.0) or 'db' to perform
      20 * np.log10(subband_envelopes / np.max(subband_envelopes)), with values
      clamped to be greater than -60. If `nonlinearity` is a python callable
      (e.g., function), it will be applied to `subband_envelopes`. If this is
      None, no nonlinearity is applied and the unmodified cochleagram is
      returned.
    invert (bool): For predefined nonlinearities 'db' and 'power', if False
      (default), the nonlinearity will be applied. If True, the nonlinearity
      will be inverted.

  Returns:
    array:
    **nonlinear_subband_envelopes**: The subband_envelopes with the specified
      nonlinearity applied.

  Raises:
      ValueError: Error if the provided `nonlinearity` isn't a recognized
